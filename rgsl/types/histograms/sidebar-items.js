initSidebarItems({"struct":[["Histogram",""],["Histogram2D","A two dimensional histogram consists of a set of bins which count the number of events falling in a given area of the (x,y) plane. The simplest way to use a two dimensional histogram is to record two-dimensional position information, n(x,y). Another possibility is to form a joint distribution by recording related variables. For example a detector might record both the position of an event (x) and the amount of energy it deposited E. These could be histogrammed as the joint distribution n(x,E)."],["Histogram2DPdf","As in the one-dimensional case, a two-dimensional histogram made by counting events can be regarded as a measurement of a probability distribution. Allowing for statistical error, the height of each bin represents the probability of an event where (x,y) falls in the range of that bin. For a two-dimensional histogram the probability distribution takes the form p(x,y) dx dy where,"],["HistogramPdf","The probability distribution function for a histogram consists of a set of bins which measure the probability of an event falling into a given range of a continuous variable x. A probability distribution function is defined by the following struct, which actually stores the cumulative probability distribution function. This is the natural quantity for generating samples via the inverse transform method, because there is a one-to-one mapping between the cumulative probability distribution and the range [0,1]. It can be shown that by taking a uniform random number in this range and finding its corresponding coordinate in the cumulative probability distribution we obtain samples with the desired probability distribution."]]});
